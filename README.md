# Accessibility Docs to Sheets

Miami University creates accessibility reports for applications and websites used by its employees and students. I made a little program to convert them into Google Sheets.

1. Create a Google OAuth API Credential.
2. Download the created json file to the same folder as the program.
3. Rename to credentials.json
4. Run program, and enter the URL of the Docs to convert.

If you wish to run the program yourself, clone the repository and then

`pip install -r requiremnts`

`python main.py`

I recommend making a virtual environment to use this.
